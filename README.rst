README file for PARE (v0.08)
====================================================================

Changes
==============
    - important bug fix during FDR computation in the previous version (v0.07).

    - now user can control the stringency level at which to search for NFRs - using the -l parameter.

    - now performs normalization of read coverage (sequencing depth normalization) after removing the PCR duplicates.

    - since v0.06 PARE supports one or more BAM files (replicates) as input. Previous versions of PARE (0.01 - 0.05) supports only two BAM files (replicates) as input. In practical terms, -j parameter is deprecated and -p parameter requires an argument now.


Description
===========
    PARE is a computational method to Predict Active Regulatory Elements (enhancers and promoters). It implements a novel approach to detect Peak-Valley-Peak (PVP) pattern defined based on H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 signal at enhancers and promoters, respectively.

    - Genomic regions enriched for H3K4me1 PVP pattern are predicted as active enhancers.

    - Genomic regions enriched for H3K4me3 PVP pattern are predicted as active promoters.

Programs and datasets
=====================
    Generally, the user would be interested in following two scripts:

    - pare: it is the main script to detect enhancers or promoters based on input BAM files (H3K4me1 - enhancers; H3K4me3 - promoters).

    - bed2direction: this script is used to detect directionality of stable transcription at promoter regions, provided as input in BED format.

    An example dataset and expected results are available at:

    - http://servers.binf.ku.dk/pare/download/test_run/

Installation
============

    1. To install PARESuite, download PARESuite.tar.gz and unpack it. A directory, PARESuite will be created

        tar -zxvf PARESuite.tar.gz

    2. Now compile and create executable blockbuster

        make or make all

    3. Export environment variable 'PAREPATH' containing path to PARESuite installation directory

        export PAREPATH=<path to PARESuite installation directory>

    4. Add 'PAREPATH' to your 'PATH' environment variable

        export PATH=$PATH:$PAREPATH/bin

    5. Add 'PAREPATH' to your 'PERL5LIB' environment variable

        export PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:$PAREPATH/share/perl/

    To permanently add or update the environment variable(s), add the last three export commands in your ~/.bashrc file

Dependency
==========

    We assume that the following programming platforms are installed and working: perl, R, and gcc. Besides, following packages should be installed.

    1. Install the needed perl modules

        sudo cpan Tie::IxHash Statistics::Basic

    2. R modules are installed by entering R (type R on the cmdline) and then enter the following three commands (follow the instructions on the screen):

        install.packages(c("ggplot2", "gridExtra", "optparse", "randomForest", "e1071"))

        source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")

        biocLite(c("DESeq"))

    3. download samtools from http://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/samtools/1.2/samtools-1.2.tar.bz2/download, go to the download location and do

        tar xjf samtools-1.2.tar.bz2

        cd samtools-1.2

        make -j10 prefix=$HOME install

    4. download bedtools from https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2/releases/download/v2.23.0/bedtools-2.23.0.tar.gz, go to the download location and do

        tar xzf BEDTools.v2.23

        cd bedtools-2.23.0/

        make -j 10

        cp bin/* $HOME/bin

    5. download featureCounts (subread) from http://sourceforge.net/projects/subread/files/subread-1.4.6-p4/, go to the download location and do

        tar xzf subread-1.4.6-p4-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz
        
        cd subread-1.4.6-p3-Linux-x86_64
        
        cp bin/featureCounts $HOME/bin

    6. download bedGraphToBigWig from http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/ for your operating system, go to the download location and do

        cp bedGraphToBigWig $HOME/bin

        chmod 755 $HOME/bin/bedGraphToBigWig

    7. download macs2 version 2.1.0 from https://github.com/taoliu/MACS/, go to the download location and install as mentioned in INSTALL.rst file

Usage
=====

    PARESuite is called with the following parameters

    pare -i <BAM file(s)> [OPTIONS]

Example
=======

    An usage example of PARESuite is shown below. As input, the method requires mapped reads in BAM format. An example dataset and expected results are available at http://servers.binf.ku.dk/pare/download/test_run/

    pare -i data/h3k4me1_helas3_Rep1.bam,data/h3k4me1_helas3_Rep2.bam -o results -m hg19 -p 10 &> pare.log

Input
=====

    As input, the method requires one or more BAM files correspondng to each replicate of H3K4me1 (enhancer prediction) or H3K4me3 (promoter prediction) ChIP-seq experiment. The name of the input file(s) should be formatted as

    Input file name (replicate 1): <unique id><Rep1>.bam (example: h3k4me1_Rep1.bam)

    Input file name (replicate 2): <unique id><Rep2>.bam (example: h3k4me1_Rep2.bam)

    .

    .

    .

    Input file name (replicate N): <unique id><RepN>.bam (example: h3k4me1_RepN.bam)

    The chromosome identifier in the input BAM files should start with chr, for example as chrY and not like Y.

Output
======

    The results from the PARESuite are presented in two text files:

    a) RESULTS.TXT: main result file in BED format 

    For easy access, the html version of this file (RESULTS.HTML) is also available within the output directory

    b) RESULTS.UCSC: file to view the enhancer and promoter regions in UCSC browser
